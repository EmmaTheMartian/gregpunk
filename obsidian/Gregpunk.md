*Attain, Analyze, Automate*

A casual but complex GregTech modpack focused around having highly intricate recipes and heavy integration with every mod available but *without* being needlessly grindy.

Gregpunk heavily reworks the "normal" progression seen in GregTech. Resources are scattered across different planets and different tiers are seen on different planets. Aluminium can be found naturally on the Moon, for example.

Gregpunk aims to use exclusively Modrinth mods, if possible. Notable exceptions to this are performance mods from `someaddon` and the FTB suite.

Around here, we like steam power. Don't expect to jump right into LV instantly! Although, the steam age has been completely revamped with the introduction of Create as a major part of the age.

Gregpunk will probably feel like an incremental game nearing the end of the modpack. I do NOT expect anyone to actually enjoy this bit of the modpack, so there are two ending points. The pack is considered finished upon obtaining a UHV namecard. However, for the completionists that enjoy incremental games and potentially repetitive gameplay, the modpack extends all the way to OpV. Completing OpV is the final challenge of Gregpunk.

## Inspirations
- GTNH (cross-mod integration)
- Star Technology (casualness)

## Style
- Basic resources should be automatable ASAP.
- Basic crafting materials (rods, sheets, motors, circuits, etc) should be automatable without extreme trouble. Logistics (pipez, pretty pipes, ae2, etc) will not be heavily gated.
- The player should be given flexibility in their progression. If there is a difficult task, there should be multiple ways to approach it.
- Quality > Quantity. The mod list should be very well thought out and not contain unmanaged overlaps or mods that add hundreds of useless blocks/items.
- Fun > Realism
- Vanilla recipes are not exempt from being tweaked.
